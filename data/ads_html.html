               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">John Durand</span>.—The Subscriber having from his Infancy 
endeavoured to qualify himself in the Art of historical Painting, 
humbly hopes for the Encouragement from the Gentlemen and Ladies of 
this City and Province, that so elegant and entertaining an Art, 
has always obtain'd from People of the most improved Minds, and 
best Taste and Judgement, in all polite Nations in every Age. 
And tho' he is sensible, that to excel (in this Branch of Painting, 
especially) requires a more ample Fund of universal and accurate 
Knowledge than he can pretend to, in Geometry, Geography, 
Perspective, Anatomy, Expression of Passions, ancient and modern 
History, &amp;c. &amp;c. Yet he hopes, from the good Nature and 
Indulgence of the Gentlemen and Ladies who employ him that his 
humble Attempts, in which his best Endeavours will not be wanting, 
will meet with Acceptance, and give Satisfaction; and he proposes 
to work at as cheap Rates as any Person in America. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idm582032"><!--anchor--></a>To such Gentlemen and Ladies as have thought but little upon this 
Subject, and might only regard painting as a superfluous Ornament, 
I would just observe, that History-painting, besides being 
extremely ornamental, has many important uses. It presents to our 
View, some of the most interesting Scenes recorded in ancient or 
modern History; gives us more lively and perfect Ideas of the 
Things represented, than we could receive from an historical 
account of them; and frequently recals to our Memory, a long Train 
of Events, with which those Representations were connected. They 
shew us a proper Expression of the Passions excited by every Event, 
and have an Effect, the very same in Kind, (but stronger) than a 
fine historical Description of the same Passage would have upon a 
judicious Reader. Men who have distinguished themselves for the 
good of their Country and Mankind, may be set before our Eyes as 
Examples, and to give us their silent Lessons, and besides, every 
judicious Friend and Visitant shares with us in the Advantage and 
Improvement, and increases its Value to ourselves.

daring Infractions of the Non-importation Agreement; his insolent 
and futile Defence of those inglorious Measures; with his avowed 
Resolution obstinately to persevere in counteracting the legal 
Efforts of a brave and free People in support of their inestimable 
Rights ‘alarmed and insenced’ the Inhabitants of this City, 
who dreading the destructive Consequence that might have ensued 
from so dangerous an Example, determined, at a General Meeting held 
on Friday Evening last, to call the said Cooley to Account; and 
prevail on him, If Possible, to desist from his vile Practices, and 
endeavour to bring him to such Concessions as should to them appear 
best calculated to attone for his repeated and unprecedented 
offences. Two Gentlemen were appointed to inform him of the 
Sentiments of the Inhabitants, who required his immediate 
Attendance at their Place of Meeting, and to assure him that no 
injury should be offered to his Person; (to prevent which, every 
imaginable Precaution was taken) but Cooley, (influenced perhaps by 
some ill-disposed and Stupid Adviser) refused to attend the Place 
appointed, and alledged in Excuse for his Non-attendance, ‘that 
he did not think it consistent with his personal Safety to meet 
them There’, at the same Time he expressed a Willingness to make 
the Concessions required, from his Parlour Window. When the 
Inhabitants received this disagreeable Intelligence, they 
immediately proceeded towards his House; but Cooley, apprized of 
their coming, thought proper to decamp, accompanied by a Military 
Gentleman, (who covered his Retreat) sought for a Sanctuary within 
the Fort Walls, which could afford him but an indifferent 
Protection against the keen Reproaches of a guilty Conscience, the 
only Punishment he had to dread. Whilst the Inhabitants were 
assembled in the Fields, M—r P—r ordered a File of Soldiers 
to guard his (Cooley's) House, who were accordingly drawn up before 
his Door, with their Musquets loaded, &amp;c. Whether the Author of 
this unwarrantable Step, designed a compliment to the Magistracy 
and Inhabitants of this City, or to recommend himself to his 
Superiors by his officious and blundering Zeal, is unknown: but 
'tis more than probable, that his precipitate Conduct was 
disapproved of by the latter,...

Four in the Afternoon being the Time appointed, and the Merchants's 
Coffee-House the Place, they assembled in Expectation of this 
Important Event; but the Majority thinking it a very unsuitable 
Place for the Purpose, required his appearance in the Fields, where 
he attended, and publickly acknowledged his Crimes; implored the 
Pardon of his Fellow Citizens; engaged to store an equivalent to 
the Goods he had sold, together with all that he had in Possession 
that were imported contrary to Agreement; and so to conduct for the 
future as not to render himself obnoxious to the Contempt and just 
Resentment of an injured People.—News item in <i>The New-York

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Benjamin Halsted</span>.—The Subscriber finds himself obliged, 
with infinite Reluctance, to address the Public on Account of a 
surrilous Advertisement in the New-York Gazette of Thursday last 
Week, signed by one Andrew Bowne. The Character and Reputation of 
a Man in Trade, being of the most delicate and tender Nature, any 
Attempts to stigmatize it, not founded on Facts, or supported by 
Evidence, will never, I flatter myself, influence the impartial 
Part of Mankind, before the Truth has been scrutinized in a legal 
Manner. But, some Time must elapse before this can be done: And as 
the Audaciousness of the Advertisement may make impressions to my 
Prejudice, I shall endeavour to remove them, by laying all my 
Transactions with Bowne, open to the Public; where by it may easily 
be perceived the Means by which his Brain was so violently heated 
as to overcome his reason. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp1576528"><!--anchor--></a>Andrew Bowne, of Shrewsbury, called on me last Summer, telling me 
Joseph Holmes, of this City, had recommended me to him as an honest 
Silversmith. He then bespoke a Set of Silver Buttons for a Suit of 
Clothes. They were made exactly to his Directions; and when he came 
to fetch them he seemed perfectly pleased with them. Three Weeks 
afterwards he called on me, and desired I would take them back. I 
represented to him how unsaleable Things made after another's Whim 
were; and that before I found a Person of his Taste, Years might 
elapse. He then offered me a Dollar; which I refusing he grew 
passionate, and went away in the greatest Anger. On his Return 
Home, he wrote me the Annexed Letter (No. 1) which I despised, and 
returned no answer to. Last May he wrote me another (No. 2) in both 
which he has been very lavish of Names that no honest Man can well 
brook. I returned him an Answer (No. 3) with a View to pass the 
Affair into Ridicule; but it had a contrary Effect; and the 
Advertisement in Question was produced by it.

violent Fire broke out in the new Free-School-House, kept by Mr. 
Joseph Hildreth, Clerk of Trinity-Church in this City; which got to 
such a Height before it was discovered, as to render it impossible 
to save it from being entirely destroyed; and tho' it stood at a 
considerable Distance from the Church, yet the Flames ascended so 
high, and carried with them such Abundance of live Coals, as to put 
the Church in imminent Danger, particularly the Steeple' which was 
set on Fire five several Times, almost at the Top, what little Wind 
there was setting directly on it; notwithstanding which, by the 
good Providence of God, and the Diligence and Activity of a few 
Persons within, who broke Holes through, it was happily 
extinguished, and preserved: There was scarce any Thing saved out 
of the House, from the Fury of the Fire; and we are assured, 
besides a great deal of Furniture and other Things, the Records of 
the Church are entirely consumed. The whole loss sustain'd, is 
supposed to be near Two Thousand Pounds Value.—News item in

to one of the Members of the Society for Arts in this City, dated 
July 22, 1767....The People of New-York, seem to me, to be too 
infatuated with a foreign Trade, ever to make any great Progress in 
Manufactures; and unless you sell your Linnen, at least as cheap as 
they can have it from Silesia, Austria, Bohemia, and Russia, thro' 
England, Holland or Hamburg, I fear you will not establish an 
extensive Manufactory:—You live in as plentiful a Country as 
any, and your People might work as cheap: I don't mean in the City 
of New-York; Cities are not calculated for Manufactures, since its 
always dearer living in them than in the Country.—News item in

I desired my Linnen Draper to get it bleach'd; he told me, that 
during 45 Years that he has been a Draper, he had never seen such 
an excellent Piece of Linnen; that as he had got a Fortune out of 
North America, it gave him Pleasure to hear it was Manufactured 
there, but as a Linnen Draper he was sorry for it. It has been 6 
weeks on the Grass, and the Bleacher says it must be in his Hands 
6 more, before it will be well whiten'd; for that he never saw a 
Piece equal to it, and desired to know of what Fabrick it was. Such 
are the Praises of your Manufacture; I hope soon to see the Day, 
that we shall import great Quantities of Linnen from New-York, into 
this kingdom as well as from Ireland and Scotland, and that Germany 
shall be excluded.—News item in <i>The New-York Gazette or the

Wife knew not what new Work to introduce; I ventured to propose 
that the Girls should now learn to read and write, and mentioned 
the necessity of a little arthmetick; but, unhappily, my Wife has 
discovered that linen wears out, and has bought the Girls three 
little wheels, that they may spin hukkaback for the servants table. 
I remonstrated, that with larger wheels they might dispatch in a 
hour, what must now cost them a day; but she told me, with 
irresistable authority, that any business is better than Idleness; 
that when these wheels are set upon a table, with mats under them, 
they will turn without noise, and keep the Girls upright; that 
great wheels are not fit for Gentlewomen; and that with these, 
small as they are, she does not doubt but that the three Girls, if 
they are kept close, will spin every year as much cloth as would 
cost five pounds, if one was to buy it.—A letter to the Printer

Lady's Head of twice the natural Size, by the Means of artificial 
Pads, Boulsters, or Rolls, over which their Hair is carefully 
combed, or frizzled to immitate the shock Head of a Negro. It would 
be ridiculous to endeavour to expose the Absurdity of Matters which 
would never bear reasoning about; but I have often wondered, since 
every Female Body is so disposed to enlarge their Stock of Hair, 
whence they procure a Sufficiency of Hair to cover the Rolls, of 
all Colours and Shades, which are exposed to Sale in every 
Milliner's Shop: And I cannot say but I was much diverted the other 
Day, when I was casually in a Harberdasher's Shop, where these 
Rolls were sold, and happened then to engage the Conversation of 
the Customers. This Question was started by a young Girl, Where the 
Hair came from which covered these Rolls? Which an old Woman 
undertook to answer from her own Knowledge. She said, that in the 
Hospitals, whatever Patients died, their Hair became the Perquisite 
of the Nurses, who carefully sheared them, to supply this great 
Demand for Human Hair. That both the Small Pox, and a Distemper 
still more disagreeable, supplied the greatest Part:...—Letter

finishes all carriages whatever in his own shop without applying to 
any other, He is likewise determined to make them as good, sell 
them as cheap, and be as expeditious as there is a posibility. And 
to convince the public of the truth of what he asserts, he will 
make any piece of work that is required, equal to any imported from 
England, and will sell it at the prime cost of that imported, by 
which means those who are pleased to favour him with their custom 
will save the freight, insurance, and expences naturally attending 
in putting the carriages to rights after they arrive. And as a 
further inducement, he will engage his work for a year after it is 
delivered, that is, if any part gives way or fails by fair usage, 
he will make it good at his own expence. Those advantages cannot be 
obtained on carriages imported. He has now a considerable stock of 
the best of all materials fit for making carriages. For the above 
reasons, he most humbly requests the encouragement of the public, 
which will be most gratefully acknowledged by him.

down the Broad Way I saw a Coach, upon which being a particular 
Coat of Arms, Crest and Motto, my Curiosity led me to enquire its 
Owner, which I found to be Coll. Morris, now in England....The 
Crest is a spacious Stone Castle, with several Divisions and 
Appartments, alluding as (I conjecture) to a Combination of Power 
and Strength; the little Turrets, Battlements, &amp;c. may serve to 
illustrate the vain Attempts his Power has made use of, to have 
established it self triumphant; the Flames within seem to discover 
a Disunion of Councils, and their Bursting forth at Top, an 
Indication that their Chiefs or Heads, venting their unruly 
Passions, are accomplishing their own Destruction. The Motto being, 
Tandem vincitur, seems to declare the Virtue, Perseverance, 
Magnanimity and Success of the Morris Family, against all such 
combined Force;...—Letter to the printer in <i>The New-York

Philosophical Optical Machine, lately invented in, and imported 
from London. I have hitherto shewed (out of near 100 Prospects) 
only two Setts, 8 in each of English Palaces, grand Building, and 
Gardens, &amp;c. Every one who has seen them, has paid me Four 
Shillings a Piece for each Set; and I must say, they have gone from 
me well satisfied; their repeated Visits and constant 
Recommendations of the Machine, convince me of what I assert.

can approve of Nothing they see others do, or with any Thing but 
what they say themselves or have a Hand in) yet as I understood, 
there were great Numbers who think much of Four Shillings, and 
knowing that there are others who really can't afford it, I began 
last week to show for Two Shillings only, the first eight English 
Prospects; and determined to have shewn them no more here. But last 
Week having been so bad weather, for the most Part, that few People 
cared to stir Abroad, I hereby give Notice, that none may miss an 
Opportunity of seeing the English Prospects, that every Morning 
this Week I will continue to shew the first 8, and every Afternoon 
and Evening, the other 8 of them, to no less than 6 Persons at a 
Time; but if a lesser Number should come, I will leave it to their 
own Generosity, according to the Satisfaction they think they 
receive. The next Monday I will begin to show, on the same easy 
Terms, nine of the French King's Palaces, and so every succeeding 
Week different Ones, in different Parts of the World, till the 
whole be gone through. After that, I intend to go to 
Philadelphia....Jo. <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Bonnin</span>.

life. A British merchant sent him to South-Carolina, where he
was used as a slave. A placid countenance, and submissive
manners, marked his resignation; and preserved him in all
situations, the possession of his arms—the only companions he
had left—the sole objects of his affections. His stateliness
and strength recommended him to Colonel Mott, a humane master, in
whose service he died, in steadfast faith of a certain
resurrection in his native state.

</p>
            <p><a name="idp5731264"><!--anchor--></a>The bow and quiver were preserved as relics of a faithful slave,
in the Colonel's family, who gratefully remember the services,
the fortitude, and the fidelity of the trusty, the gentle Iambo.

</p>
            <p><a name="idp5731856"><!--anchor--></a>In the campaign of 1781, the widow of Colonel Mott, (who died a
patriot) was banished from her house, on the river Congaree,
then fortified by a British garrison; the garrison was besieged
by a small detachment from the American army, whose approaches
were soon within bow-shot. The widow, who lived in a cottage in
sight of the fort, was informed that the preservation of her
house was the only impediment to its reduction—and she was
informed of the expedients proposed. Here, said she, (presenting
the African bow and quiveri) are the materials—Iambo never
used these arrows and I fear they are poisoned; use them not,
therefore, ever against your enemies—but take the bow, any
arrow will waft the match. Spare not the house, so you expel the
foe. The blazing roof prduced submission—the Britons dropped
their arms—the Americans entered the house, and both joined to
extinquish the flames.

</p>
            <p><a name="idp5733696"><!--anchor--></a>The misfortunes of a Prince, and the heroism of a lady, are not
uncommon—the novelty is the Bow—a stem of genuine
bamboo—which, destined for the defence of Liberty in Africa,
served the same cause in America, was preserved by an officer of
the patriot army—presented to Mr. Peale and is not deposited
in his museum.—<i>Gazette of the United States</i>, August

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">John Trumbull</span>.—Extracts of a letter from New York,
February 27. The justly celebrated Trumbull is now busily engaged
in his great undertaking—the productions you may depend
will be a most valuable acquisition to the world—to the
American world in particular. I have seen some of the pieces in
which a few heads and some portraits are finished—the likeness
are perfect—the drawing, Nature Itself—and the designs
sentimental, elevated and just. In short, here is no
risque—the object is sure, and the mind is perfectly
satisfied—it rests in the execution. (Mass. Gen.)

by Trumbull and a fine thing it is; designed and executed in his
superior style of excellence. It is full length, in his uniform

relieved, in contrast with a luminous cloud and fine light
sky—nearly a front psition, with his right hand and arm thrown
on the saddle of an elegant white horse, with inimitable
ease—the beast in the action of biting the middle joint of
his near foreleg—this position of the horse shows his neck to
great advantage, while it leave the President's head as it ought
to be, the most conspicuous object in the picture. There are
distant prospects of particular interesting scenes, as

of New York. It is therefore a warm, and highly animated

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">[Jean Antoine] Houdon</span>, A french sculptor of eminence, has 
lately finished a very fine bust of General Washington. To be 
enabled to execute the likeness, the artist went to 
Philadlephia, and lived six months in Washington's family. The 
character and attitude of the founder and defender of American 
liberty, of the representative of a happy and peaceful nation, 
of the protector of agriculture, that abundant source of national 
wealth, are happily imagined, and as happily executed in his 
performance. It was particularly this last mentioned character, 
the agriculture, that Houdon had in view. The simple costume of 
the figure, expressly chosen with view, has been much criticised 
in America, where taste is yet in its infancy. The Americans 
wished to contemplate a Roman hero decorated with all the 
attributes of a conqueror whereas Houdon, on the contrary, aimed 
to represent the protector of the arts, of peace and liberty. It 
was the interposition of Washington himself which decided in the 
general assembly the execution of the artists ideas. The figure 
is arrayed in the simple and noble dress of a man in rural 
life, a light plaited vest half buttoned, sandals on his feet, 
with a cloak, fastened on his breast, and flowing over his 
shoulders and back, suited to protect an agricultor from the 
inclemency of the weather. One hand is supported by a staff; 
the rest on the republican fasces crowned with a cap of 
liberty, At his feet is a plough.—<i>The Spectator</i>,

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Counterfeiting</span>.—The citizens are cautioned against 
the impositors of villains who are passing counterfeit Five 
Shillings Bills. The paper is of a darker colour than the true 
bills; The types are old, and not well printed. It is a 
misfortune that we have two kinds of genuine five shilling 
bills. The counterfeits are in imitation of those which have a 
heavy bordering. They may easily be detected, by observing that 
the eagle on the globe, in the state arms, in the counterfeits, 
is badly imitated, the wing extending towards the figure of 
liberty is too large; and the other very short and small: and 
the globe on which the eagle stands is too large and black. In 
the body of the true bills, in the words FIVE, the V is smaller 
than the other letters, and the word appears crooked. In the 
bordering of the true bills the FIVE SHILLINGS at the end to the 
right are irregular and incline to the left; in the counterfeits, 
these words are more erect, and the letters closer together, 
large and very pale. The signing is not well done, and the bad 
bills are something larger and wider than the true 
ones.—<i>New-York Packet</i>, May 1, 1787. [New York news

attention bestowed in finishing the drawings with neatness, and 
accuracy, the tedious difficult executions of plates of such 
large dimensions together with an ardent desire to render the 
work compleat, will rescue the publishers from the censure of 
unnecessary delay; whose only wish is to gratify the admirers of 
picturesque nature and whose ultimate object will be, not only to 
interest the United States, but the European world, by a general 
display of those captivating, elegant scenes, which are so 
profusely distributed over the American continent. The following

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Upon the Manufacture of Glass</span>. Bottles, black or green, 
are the most simple of all glass manufacture—the profits in 
making which depends upon the greatest number of workmen being 
employed at the smallest expense of fuel. From eight to sixteen 
blowers can work all at once, at one melting furnace, six feet 
diameter, which will take six cords of wood every twenty four 
hours. The best constructed green glass furnace in this country 
is in New Jersey—where the whole business of smelting, 
blowing, and cooling is done with one fire, by the particular 
construction of the furnace. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp6806640"><!--anchor--></a>White glass may also be made in the same furnace: but it is much 
more curious in its composition; for to make it white, it must 
partake of all the colours—for this reason—in smelting the 
purest materials, they naturally have a greenish and purplish 
tinge; to dislodge which a blackish fossil substance is made use 
of—upon this principle, that one colour in glass making will 
destroy another; so that at last a beautiful glass is produced 
called white; but like the christaline humor of the eye, it 
partakes of all the colours, as may be seen in the best English 
white glass which has a changeableness like soap bubbles; but in 
the best London crown glass, or mirrours, you will not perceive 
any of that sparkling, changeable power, because it would 
destort the object seen through or reflected, on account of 
the refracting power of such glass; therefore this glass is 
made of pure salts and sands only and has a native greyish 
colour, as may be seen by the broken pieces that, like water, 
they may reflect the objects truly. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp6809456"><!--anchor--></a>Crown glass may be made here to greater profit than any other 
glass—on account of the plenty and cheapness of

inconvenience of spilling oil; but it is curious in these, that 
in the most violent motion held horizontal, or even inverted, 
the oil cannot escape, and by their being made air tight, the 
oil (like the quick-silver in a weather glass) is defended from 
the pressure of the atmosphere, which as well as preventing its 
coagulating, causes it to slip much lighter and further to the 
burners, burn brighter, and if properly trimmed with fresh cotton 
and fine oil, will not want snuffing while burning through twelve 
or fourteen hours continuance. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp7253904"><!--anchor--></a>They will not only give as much clear light and less smoke than 
candles, but are cleaner and safer, which makes them fit for 
parlours, bed-chambers, halls, stair cases, and extremely useful 
for kitchens, stores manufactories, and on board ship. Their 
simplicity, and easy manner of trimming, and particularly the 
small quantity of oil they burn, renders it an object universally 
to be adopted for every place where light is 
required.—<i>American Minerva</i>, February 12, 1795.

            <p><a name="idp7934224"><!--anchor--></a>It is said, that the inhabitants of cold climates are more liable 
to inflammatory and consumptive disorders than those of warm 
climates....and it is a question, whether close or open fire 
places are the wholesomest? Prejudice among the Americans is 
great against those that are close, such as stoves. Whether facts 
are prevalent in support of this bias, may be questions. Perhaps 
the Germans of Pennsylvania, who universally use stoves, are less 
liable to consumptions than people who are accustomed to the open 
chimney fires....The German may be as safe in his extremes, 
as the Indian who heats himself in his hovel by means of hot 
stoves till he drips with sweat, and then plunges into a river 
of cold water....a writer in a British periodical paper...is of 
the opinion, that the pulmonary consumption of Britain is 
chiefly caused by the unequal distribution of heat, by means 
of open coal fires.—<i>The Diary; or Loudon Register</i>,

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8073184"><!--anchor--></a>The advantage of this mill over one constructed with a crank, 
arises from its working by means of a lever of an optional 
length, so applied as to create and up and down or circular 
motion, by this means it has the advantage of ten feet to two, 
of purchase; and the lever being on a balance, has thus a 
tendecy to throw off the friction from the wheels of the 
machinery; The lever runs but on third of the circumference with 
the strain of the saw when cutting, the other two thirds runs 
entirely clear, by which you regain the motion the stroke of the 
saw in some measure retards. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8074176"><!--anchor--></a>This is allowed to be the only construction which, after 
getting a certain motion also gains power, owing to its leaving 
the works so clear of friction.

there are many persons who doubt the possibility of securing 
houses, &amp;c. from the ravages or accidental fires, and others 
who admit, yet imagine that a chemical preparation of some kind 
is necessary, think it proper to set the public (for whose 
benefit his inventions are intended) right, of informing them 
briefly, 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8115648"><!--anchor--></a>1. That his method for preventing whole houses or a single room 
from being destroyed by fire, for which he obtained a patent, 
are simple, certain and permanent, and do not depend upon any 
chemical preparation whatever. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8116272"><!--anchor--></a>2. That he stops the spread of accidental fire, by rendering 
those parts of a house the most exposed to, and the least 
qualified for resisting the force of, fire, secure with solid 
materials, as any pavements. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8116880"><!--anchor--></a>3. Air being the active principle of fire, he hinders its 
admission and escape by closing the doors and windows and the 
chimney (if there be one in the room where the fire begins) by a 
valve, in consequence of which, any further progress of the fire 
is greatly retarded, if not wholly stopped, by the suffocating 
power of its own smoke. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8117968"><!--anchor--></a>This chimney valve is so contrived, that on the approach of any 
extraordinary degree of flame, it closes, by which means, if the 
chimney only happens to take fire, it will extinquish itself 
instantly, without giving trouble or alarm to anyone. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8118624"><!--anchor--></a>4. That it provides for the immediate Retention of the 
accidental fires; a reservoir under the floor of the house, to be 
filled with rain water, in which to augment its extenguishing 
power, he dissolves a quantity of pot ash. This water is to be 
conducted down the stair way, by a pipe, from whence it may on 
emergency be conveyed without loss of time to any part of the 
house where the fire may happen to begin. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8119440"><!--anchor--></a>5. These reservoirs will be found useful in preserving houses 
from accidental fires that may happen within but also a certain 
defence against the approach of any neighboring conflagration. 
They will also be found an effectual security to high and 
extensive ranges of warehouses, built wholly of timber, which on 
account of their situation on wharfs, &amp;c. cannot always, in 
case of fire, be surrounded by men and engines, collected to 
extinquish the flames. Note. Those who secure their own workmen; 
his price for superintending the securing of a single room, in 
the city, is five dollars.

            <p><a name="idp8188800"><!--anchor--></a>The Master Carpenters have long made it a pratice to employ

tools,) upon very low wages, while they charge the employer 12s. 
per day, the wages only paid to good workmen, and from which they 
have 1s. 6d. per day; for what reason? Because their ignorant 
Journeymen are taught by us, what the Masters ought to instruct 
them in.

our case to every candid Reader, who undoubtedly will justify 
our conduct in putting a stop to such iniquitous practices; 
therefore, in order to do justice to ourselves and the Public in

o'clock P. M. the Most Illustrious President of the U. S. 
arrived in this city. At Elizabethtown, he was received by a 
deputation of three Senators and five Representatives of the 
United States—..and three Officers of the State and 
Corporation—with whom he embarked on board the Barge, built 
for the purpose of wafting him across the Bay. Thirteen Pilots 
in white uniforms rowed this Barge, Thomas Randall, Esq., 
acting as Cockswain. It is impossible to do justice in an 
attempt to describe the scene exhibited on his Excellency's 
approach to the city. Innumerable multitudes thronged the shores, 
the wharves, and the shipping, waiting with pleasing anticipation 
his arrival. His Catholick Majesty's Sloop of War, the Galviston, 
the Ship North Carolina (Mr. Dohrman's) and other vessels were 
dressed, manned and highly decorated. His Excellency's Barge was 
accompanied by several other Barges, in one of which were the 
Hon. the Board of the Treasury, and the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, and the Secretary of War, besides a long train of 
vessels and boats from New-Jersey and New-York. As he passed the 
Galviston, she fired a salute of 13 guns. The ship, North 
Carolina, and the Battery, also welcomed his approach with the 
same number. The whole water scene was highly animated—moving 
in regular order—the grand Gala formed an object the most 
interesting imaginable. On his Excellency's arrival at the 
stairs, prepared and ornamented, at Murray's Wharf, for his 
landing, he was saluted by Col. Bauman's artillery, and received 
and congratulated by his Excellency the Governour, and the 
Officers of the State and Corporation—from whence the 
procession moved in the following order....The procession moved 
through Queen Street to the House prepared for the reception of 
the President—from whence he was conducted, without form, to 
the Governour's where his Excellency dined.

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Marine Ventilators</span> invented by Mr. Benjamin Wynkoop, for 
ventilating ships, may justly be numbered with the most important 
nautical improvements. The simplicity, durability, and Compact 
structure of the machines, are peculiarly adapted to the 
purpose for which they were designed; and their constant 
vibration, produced by the motion of the ship alone, will keep the 
air in free circulation throughout the remotest parts of the 
ship. Those who are immediately acquainted with the injurious 
effects of foul air on the health of the persons on board ships, 
and on perishable Cargoes, as well as the frames of ships, will 
justly appreciate their worth. It excites astanishment that a 
subject of such magnitude should have been so long neglected, 
when we take into view, the still more important consideration of 
the fatal effects produced by the introduction of pestilential 
diseases into our ports. Those diseases in many instances are 
doubtless generated on board of ships (not ventilated) by the 
putrid exhalations from perishible materials on board, which 
are ultimately discharged on our shores, and like Pandora's box 
spread disease and desolation thro our flourishing Cities. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8285488"><!--anchor--></a>These remarks are a result of the beneficial effect experienced 
from two such ventilators on board the brig Benjamin Franklin, 
on her late passage from Bourdeaux. Her Cargo was altogether 
wines, near 800 HHDS. of which were Claret wines; it is liable to 
fermentation, and consequently very considerable loss; the Cargo 
was landed in the most perfect order perhaps ever witnessed on 
a similar Cargo, after filling up the Casks the loss did not 
exceed one and a half per cent. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8286368"><!--anchor--></a>By the operation of the ventilators the hold was kept perfectly 
cool, the bilge water free from smell, and the paint work not in 
the least discolored. On his voyage previous to the construction 
of the ventilators on board, the reverse of all this was the 
case, and only 90 HHDS. of wine on board.

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">New York Air Furnace</span>, Peter T. Curtenius and Co. have 
repaired the New-York Air Furnace, and have procured the best 
workmen together with the necessary apparatus to carry on the 
Manufactory of Cast Iron in the completest and best manner. 
Castings made in an Air Furnace, are allowed by all who are 
acquainted with the nature of Founderies, to be better than what 
is made in a Blast Furnace; because, in an Air Furnace, the ware 
is made out of the softest and best Pig Metal, and, by its 
being melted a second time, the scoria, or dross, is expelled 
and nothing but the pure Metal remains. In a Blast Furnace, the 
castings are made out of the first smelting of the crude Ore, 
and are more or less mixt with dross, which subjects the ware to 
be rough and spongy, and often full of cold shuts; the 
difference, in short, is nearly the same as there is between 
refined and Bloomery Iron. The ware they have made is allowed, 
by good judges, to be as light, as smooth, and as good as any 
imported from Europe. This consideration alone, of the ware being 
as good as the foreign, is a sufficient inducement, for an 
American, to give the preference to the manufactures of his own 
country; but a more powerful argument for the purchaser to give 
it a preference is, that it can be afforded cheaper than the 
imported ware, chiefly owning to a duty of six pounds per ton 
being laid on foreign castings. The ware manufactured at this 
Furnace, consists of the following articles, viz. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8642336"><!--anchor--></a>Pots and kettles of various sizes from one to fifteen gallons, 
tea kettles, pye pans, skillets, griddles, potash kettles and 
coolers, whaling kettles, boilers for tallow chandlers and sugar 
works, stoves for sugar bakers, mill cases, cast bars for sugar 
works and distilleries, rollers and shears for slitting mills, 
chimney backs, hearth and jamb plates, cast agreeable to any 
pattern that may be sent; close stoves for work shops, Franklin 
stoves neatly decorated with carved work, Bath stoves grates 
elegantly ornamented with carvings, ship's cabouses of the new 
construction, with bake ovens in them, in which the same fire

</p>
            <p><a name="idp8737168"><!--anchor--></a>The counterfeit French guineas, which are the worst executed, may 
be known by the sound being flat. The hair of the head resembles 
balls or lumps, instead of natural curls, and is too great in 
breadth. These pieces weigh a little more than three penny 
weight, and are made of copper gilded. The counterfeit dollars 
are dated 1782, and to be distinquished by the out line of 
the back of the head, which is not sufficiently round; the 
nostril un-natural, and not enough raised on the outside; the III 
after carolus too small and crouded, and the face too long. Some 
are blanced copper, others of copper silvered, or, as the artists 
express it, boiled.

downcast, and the nose and forehead too erect; the eyebrow not 
raised; the nose too broad, the colour resembling brass, and the 
fleurs de lis in the crown, which they ought not. They seem to 
be a composition of gold, silver and copper, and want but a few

machine is recommended to the public as a cheaper and more 
expeditious way of cooking and boiling water than any before 
invented. It is particularly convenient for masters of vessels 
as it will enable them to cook in the cabbin, when the weather 
will not permit them on deck. It's great saving of fuel making 
it an object to those families or persons who wish to less the 
expence of that necessary &amp; costly article, while for 
convenience it is useful to all, as a kettle of water for the 
tea may be boiled in 6 minutes, with a sheet of paper, a few 
shavings, or any combustible. It will cook a steak very nicely 
in 3 minutes, also veal cutlets, mutton chops fricasee, hash 
meats of any kind, boil eggs, etc. It is very convenient for 
gentlemen in Chambers as it quite precludes the necessity of 
lighting a fire in the chimney. It is likewise very convenient 
on fishing parties, as the fish may be boiled immediately as 
they are taken out of the water, in a vessel without a fireplace 
or caboose, come and see the Conjuror, it is perfectly innocent

Paper, are not acquainted with the real cause of their not being 
weekly supplied with the news for some time past, the Printer 
now informs them, that scarcity of printing paper, and frequent 
disappointments in his endeavors to obtain it, are the reasons. 
He early last Fall, sent cash to a friend in Philadelphia, 
where he was encouraged to hope for a constant supply; but was 
disappointed though he went there himself, owing to the great 
demand for paper by the printers in that city, who generally 
engross it at the paper mills. He had frequently before sent to 
Boston and Connecticut for paper, where he had received a few 
scatry supplies; and was encouraged last fall to expect a stock 
for winter from Connecticut, having sent value before-hand to 
purchase it: none, however was forwarded by land while the roads 
were passable, but delayed till January, when a number of reams 
were shipped, in order to be landed in Fairfield, which unhappily 
were taken by the enemy.

State; and though but one, it can scarcely be supported with 
a sufficient quantity of rags. The reason is obvious, viz. 
inattention in our grave old matrons, and carelessness in those 
of fewer years. It is therefore sincerely wished, that our 
citizens, but particularly the Ladies and Taylors, would be 
careful in reserving all their useless linen fragments for the

were in Venice several men of distinquished abilities, who 
espoused different parties; but, being members of the church, 
close to combat their adversaries, and support their cause with 
their pen; and that their arguments might become universal, and 
fall into the hands of the meanest of the people, their productions 
were sold for the smallest piece of coin then in circulation at

been named gazettes, and all writers of public intelligence

               <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fashions</span>. Before the Croisades cost the Christian world 
so many millions of subjects, there was a sort of uniform dress in 
Europe.—Those who returned from the ineffectual wars of 
Palestine, were the first to bring with them the fashions of the 
East, and the most remarkable of these was the long cloak, which 
in the 12th century reached only to the knee; but before the 
15th century, the nobility assumed a long train, imagining that 
the abasement of the servant gave a greater appearance of 
dignity to the master. But knights and princes only were allowed 
to wear those cloaks, and their consorts the robe, sometimes 
with and without gold. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp9602240"><!--anchor--></a>For the space of above three centuries, people had the appearance 
of quiet members of society; no such thing as a sword by way of 
dress; nobility was noted by a long purse hanging at the girdle, 
a custom maintained by the Highlanders at this day; whereas the 
piece of iron which our modern gentleman now sticks at his side, 
carries with it an air of suspicion and turbulency. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp9603024"><!--anchor--></a>The covering for the head was a hood, with a roll or pad at top, 
and a tail hanging behind. This was worn by the Irish, even early 
in the present century, the peasantry of that nation being the 
last who retained it in Europe. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp9603648"><!--anchor--></a>In Henry the 7th's time, and even in Henry the 8th's, emblazoned 
or party-coloured cloaths were worn, like our present heralds and 
pursuivants, quartered in patches of family arms, as were also 
the bipartite garments, half of one colour, and half of another. 
But things will change, and in the meridian of the latter Princes 
reign, Francis the first introduced the fashion of short clothes, 
like the pantaloon dress, being a doublet short skirted, and 
drawers and stockings all of a piece; this being close, and 
yielding to the body, caused many indecent appearances. Some 
serious people introduced the Swiss breeches, a sort of trunk 
hose, which came down only to the middle of the thighs, and over 
it a half petticoat. To this succeeded the exact dress of our 
running footmen. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp9604848"><!--anchor--></a>As the ladies may be curious to know how their sex was dressed, 
they will be gratified in being told, that in 1409 the head dress 
was a high sugar-loaf bonnet, with a veil fastened to the top 
of it, and hanging down more or less, according to the persons 
rank. The veil of a citizens wife came only to the shoulders, 
that of a knight's lady swept the ground.—In Henry the 
VIIIth's time, the ladies wore little hats, with a feather; from 
that time to the year 1600, succeeded small caps, with aigrettes 
or pompoons. 

</p>
            <p><a name="idp9606304"><!--anchor--></a>In 1650, the men took it into their heads that a big belly had 
something majestic in it, on which the women (like the women of 
the present day) immediately fancied that prominent posteriors 
were equally ornamental; then appeared nothing but false big 
bellies, and false big bottoms; and ridiculous as this custom 
was, it lasted near four years. What is very odd, no sooner had 
it began, than the sex seemed to give themselves no farther 
concern about their faces; for they hid them under a mask, never 
failing to put it on when they went abroad; this continued down 
to the end of the last century. The masks were superceded by 
patches, used to such extravagance, as to make the face 
scarcely discernible. To this succeeded <i>rouge</i>, copied from 
the Roman Generals, who painted on public triumphs. This custom 
is still retained, with all the other pretty extravagancies 
introduced in the dresses of our modern daughters of Eve, who 
seem totally to forget the naked simplicity of their 
grand-dames.—<i>Independent Journal: or, the General

In several instances he observed, that a considerable part of

against the rain, as the umbrellas from their smallness, were 
insufficient to cover them. It is therefore hoped that the next 
importation of Umbrellas will be of a larger

            <p><a name="idp10068720"><!--anchor--></a>The Forte-Piano is become so exceedingly fashionable in Europe that 
few polite families are without it. This much esteemed instrument 
forms an agreeable accompaniment for the female voice, takes up 
but little room, may be moved with ease, and consequently kept 
in tune with little attention—so that it is on that account 
supperior to the harpsi-chord. The improvements which Messrs. 
Dodds and Clause have made in the Forte-Piano, has rendered it 
much more acceptable than those imported. The introduction of 
their new invented hammers and dampers, is acknowledged to be a 
great improvement, as also the means they have taken to prepare 
their wood to stand the effect of our Climatte, which imported 
instruments never do, but are sure to suffer not only from the 
agitation of the vessel, but the saline qualities of the seas. 
One great advantage to the purchaser is, that Messrs. Dodds and 
Claus make it an invariable rule to repair any instrument that 
may prove defective in the workmanship, if applied to within 2 
years after delivery. At this manufactory every kind of musical 
instruments are finished according to the present taste, and 
with the latest improvements, as good and cheap as in the City 
of London. Instruments sold on commission, taken in exchange, let 
out, repaired and tuned, in the best manner and on the most

most agreeable effect. At six o'clock, P.M. Mr. Busselot began to 
fill the balloon, which exhibited the most beautiful appearance 
to a respectable and numerous company. It rose with some 
difficulty, on account of the breeze having entirely failed; it 
ascended most majestically about 3000 feet, which distance from 
the ground it constantly kept until its fall on the Jersey 
shore, having in the course of 35 minutes vaulted about six 
miles in the air without any breeze.—<i>New-York Packet</i>,

ascension from the prison yard to the aerial regions....At last, 
everything being ready, Mr. Blanchard respectfully took his 
leave of the President, who gave him a folded paper, which we 
suppose to be a recommendation to the inhabitants of whatever 
place he may light upon. After he had taken his leave, the 
president called him back and said something to him that we did 
not hear. Then the aeronaut, having bowed to the Spectators, 
ascended his boat, which was printed blue, and spangled with 
stars on the outside and, holding in his hand a flag with the 
colours of the United States, he threw out part of his ballast, 
and precisely at 5 minutes past 10 o'clock, the balloon rose 
slowly and perpendicularly to soft music, amidst the shouts and 
burst of applause of all the Spectators. The President took off 
his hat, and bowed to him as he ascended....It was indeed a 
spectacle as magnificent as it was new to us, to see this intrepid 
aeronaut majestically rise from the earth without betraying the 
least symptom of fear on his countenance, but smiling on the 
astonished spectators whose hearts were filled with an anxiety he 
did not seem to partake. As he rose, he gracefully moved his 
flag, as taking an affectionate farewell of his friends. `Bon 
Voyage, God bless you, all', was reechoed from every mouth, hats 
waved, hands lifted up, all testified the interests that every 
beholder took in the success of this bold undertaking. For some 
minutes the shouts of applause were suspended, and an awful 
silence best expressed at this moment the feelings of the 
spectators....Indeed we are at a loss to account for the little 
encouragement that Mr. Blanchard has received in this city....We 
are credibly informed that the amount of Subscriptions will fall 
short by 400 £ of reimbursing his expences. Our credit as a 
liberal Nation is at stake....About half past 6 o'clock we were 
happy to see Mr. Blanchard again in this city....he informed us 
his aerial voyage lasted 46 minutes, in which time he ran over a 
space of more than 15 miles, and then descended a little to the 
eastward of Woodbury in the State of New Jersey where he took a 
carriage and returned to Cooper's ferry and was at the 
President's, as we have already mentioned at half past 6 o'clock 
in the evening.—<i>New-York Daily Advertiser</i>, January 12,

flight. This liberality is daily becoming exemplified by the 
increased subscriptions, but the fatigues of waiting on the 
citizens at this very warm season, is very great. G. B. 
particularly solicits, that those liberal ladies and gentlemen, 
who wish to be partakers in the great expence that will attend 
the preparations of this very interesting scene, are requested 
to subscribe on some of the subscription papers which are left at 
the coffee houses and other public places, as soon as possible,

Gifford and Scotland, will be intitled to much merit for this

Pedestal appear two beautiful youths, represented playing upon 
flutes, very animated; above these appear a very handsome Lady, 
seated under a rich canopy, (beautifully decorated with drapery) 
playing the Piano-Forte; above, on the top of the canopy a small 
globe appears, surrounded by a beautiful sky with clouds 
interspersed. An Eagle hovering, suspending in its beak, a shield 
with the fifteen united stripes, in one talon an olive branch, in 
the other a bundle of arrows; above these is seen glittering 
rays with fifteen stars interspersed, and over this the eye of 
Providence. On the top of the Case, is seen, in burnished gold, 
in the centre, Fame, with his trumpet, in a handsome attitude; 
on his right, Justice, and on  his left Liberty—very

The subscriber informs the public that he has manufactured several 
hundred paid of sleeve buttons. The substance is the Shell of the 
American Pearl Mussle, in its native unpolished state. It will be 
found on examination, to be plain and really beautiful, and is 
one of the most elegant natural substances for the manufacture of 
buttons ever discovered. (the richest and most valuable pearl is 
found in the shell of this mussle) these buttons are the first 
article that has ever been manufactured from the shell of this 
mussle, and is a most excellent proof that the fresh water brooks 
of our country afford a valuable article of convenience and 
ornament; the buttons are for sale at the Museum, and at the 
store of Messrs Staples &amp; Sons, and Hawxharsts &amp; Demilts, 
in Pearl Street. Gardiner Baker, Museum, in the

O'clock on Monday afternoon, being the 8th inst. a very curious 
and extraordinary Philosophical Experiment will be shewn at the 
Museum. A small brass cannon will be charged in the presence of 
the audience apparently with nothing, the gun will then be 
conveyed to an elevated place above peoples heads, and discharge at 
command with a loud report, when no person will be near it, this 
is discharging a cannon without being loaded with powder or 
without its having a vent or without any fire being applied to 
the same. A candle will also be lighted instantly only by turning 
a screw. This beautiful experiment will, I flatter myself, please 
and astonish the audience, and I hope there will be many witness 
to approbate the same. Gardiner Baker Proprietor of Tammany
